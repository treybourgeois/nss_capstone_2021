## Intent and Summary

This project's aim is to analyze some of the causes of coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the abundance of coral species in relevance to other species, as well as exploring the catalysts in our changing environment which aid the process of coral bleaching. 

## Why explore this data? 

I wanted to combine my interests for geography, maps, and nature into a project that could yeild interesting insights to a problem that I was aware of, but wanted to educate myself further on. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is a thriving ecosystem and one of the 7 Underwater Wonders of the World.

Two of the most impactful and significant bleaching events happened from 2015-2017, I tried to base my findings and reports within this time frame specifically to tell a story of what caused this to occur.

## Data Questions

- What are the main driving forces that cause coral bleaching to occur?
- How often are these events taking place, and how does it look over time?
- Are the causes and effects of coral bleaching exacerbated more by nature or humans?

## Known Issues and Challenges
Upon exploring the data, I found that tourism in Australia greatly affected the life cycle of the Great Barrier Reef, I wanted to explore how and why that happened, and what tourism looks like for coral reef visits, bringing in population data and tourism data to support my findings, which I did not have enough time for. Briefly skimming through data, near coastal destinations, local infrastructure is strained, waste treatment is mismanaged and as a result, natural habitats are destroyed.

Also as of 6/22/21, new findings by UNESCO suggests placing the Great Barrier Reef on the list of World Heritage sites that are "in danger", because of things like climate change and according to ABC news, sunscreen pollution which is causing the demise of corals. Australia plans to challenge this, but again I didn't have enough time to thorougly investigate any truth in the matter. Corals need an abundance of sunlight to flourish, and apparently the chemical pollutant of sunscreen and lotions are being introduced to local waters.

## Impacts and Effects
### Global Warming
- Weather Events
- Changing Water Temperatures
- Ocean Acidification
- Pollution

## Bleaching Events
A look at total bleaching events from 1980-2015. Greater than 30% total corals bleached is considered severe.

## Weather Events
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural climate phenomenon that affects surface water temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It transitions between the El Niño part of the cycle, which is the warm phase, and the La Niña which is the cool phase.

Bleaching is usually worse in El Niño years when surface waters become warmer. In the chart we see the number of bleaching events, colored by the phase of the ENSO cycle at the time. El Niño years are shown in blue; La Niña in orange; and moderate years between these transitions in green.

## Changing Water Temperature
A main cause of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef is changing water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, three main factors we will explore here are Ocean Acidification, Ocean Heat, and Sea Surface Temperature.

## Ocean Acidification

## Pollution
A look at global plastic production since 1950, per million tons, which breaks down in the ocean as microplastics endangering animals and ecosystems.

### C02 Emissions and Global Carbon Budget
Rising sea levels and ocean acidification are the result of rising carbon emissions, which are represented here. We also take a look at the global carbon budget, which is the amount of C02 a country is allowed to emit annually.
