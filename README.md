## Intent and Summary

This project's aim is to analyze some of the causes of coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the abundance of coral species in relevance to other species, as well as exploring the catalysts in our changing environment which aid the process of coral bleaching. 

## Why explore this data? 

I wanted to combine my interests for geography, maps, and nature into a project that could yeild interesting insights to a problem that I was aware of, but wanted to educate myself further on. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is a thriving ecosystem and one of the 7 Underwater Wonders of the World.

## Data Questions

- What are the main driving forces that cause coral bleaching to occur?
- How often are these events taking place, and how does it look over time?
- Are the causes and effects of coral bleaching exacerbated more by nature or humans?

## Impacts and Effects
### Global Warming
- Weather Events
- Changing Water Temperatures
- Ocean Acidification
- Pollution

## Weather Events
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural climate phenomenon that affects surface water temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It transitions between the El Niño part of the cycle, which is the warm phase, and the La Niña which is the cool phase.

Bleaching is usually worse in El Niño years when surface waters become warmer. In the chart we see the number of bleaching events, colored by the phase of the ENSO cycle at the time. El Niño years are shown in blue; La Niña in orange; and moderate years between these transitions in green.

## Changing Water Temperature

## Ocean Acidification

## Pollution
A look at global plastic production since 1950, per million tons, which breaks down in the ocean as microplastics endangering animals and ecosystems.
