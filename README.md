An Analysis of the Great Barrier Reef: Environmental Impacts and Causes of Coral Bleaching

1. Brief history and overview of coral bleaching
  - intro to coral bleaching
  - focus on the catalysts that have affected the calcification of dying coral, the ecosystems that are changing over time, global warming, and any wildlife that have been forced into a new way of life because of this, including new migratory patterns or even species that have been threatened by extinction, tourism, pollution, is this happening due to over-fishing
  - what are some main causes of coral bleaching
  - how long has coral bleaching been going on
  - focus on specific timeline of known coral bleaching events (2015-2017 seemed to be the two years with the heaviest bleaching events)
  - *bleaching events CSV* ??

2. Global Warming/Changing Water Temperatures
  - Enzo storm data research, both tables - brief overview of Enzo storm history
  - - *severe bleaching events*??
  - It is known that the main reason for coral bleaching is due to rising water temperatures
  - acidity levels across oceans
  - sea rise and any other general global warming sea level temp trends
  - compare other oceans over time and see if the Pacific ocean has changed in temperature at a different rate to other bodies of water. 
  - *zoning coordinates CSV*?? see if this is useful at all somehow with json
 
3. Wildlife/Ecosystems/Extenction Threat
- Who has been most affected by coral bleaching, pull in tables to analyze, compare and contrast
- *list of species CSV*
- *list of threatened CSV*
- *list of described species CSV*
- *list of fish threatened CSV*
- *list of perc coral coverage in specific area, as well as perc fish in specific area*
- ^^*USE WORD DOC eATLAS DATA SET REPORT TO EXPLAIN FINDINGS*^^

4. Tourism
- How does tourism affect the Great Barrier Reef?
- Pull in tourism data CSV.. focus on certain years? 


5. Pollution
- *global plastics pollution CSV*
- *national carbon emissions CSV*
- *global carbon budget CSV* (data sets for 2020 and 2017, 2020 has the json)
- find more data on plastic manufacturing? or specific pollution per country?
- which oceans are most polluted


*add reference page
*try to add downloaded json to some capacity
