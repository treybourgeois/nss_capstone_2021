1. Brief history and overview of coral bleaching
  - what are some main causes of coral bleaching
  - focus on the catalysts that have affected the calcification of dying coral, the ecosystems that are changing over time, and any wildlife that have been forced into a new way of life because of this, including new migratory patterns or even species that have been threatened by extinction. 
  - It is known that the main reason for coral bleaching is due to rising water temperatures. 
  - How long has coral bleaching been going on, and what does it primarily affect, how do these changes overtime affect the longevity of the Great Barrier Reef, and what happens to the region if it is not reversed?
-What are the primary causes for coral bleaching, is it due to weather changes and climate change, tourism, pollution, is this happening due to over-fishing, or is this a man-made problem?
-Who has been most affected by coral bleaching, is it the ecosystem itself, or does it affect one thing more drastically than all the rest?
-What would the world’s oceans look like without the Great Barrier Reef, what would a chain reaction look like if this ecosystem did not exist?
-How can coral bleaching be reversed, and does that truly bring the ecosystem back to it’s natural state, or will other lifeforms be sacrificed by means of artificial or lab made solutions?

I would like my final capstone to have the following overview:

-Brief History of The Great Barrier Reef and its importance to the region/world/symbiotic relationships to other oceans

-I would include a visual timeline, likely a lineplot here to show when coral bleaching was first discovered, and the percentage of the Reef that has died over time to modern day.

-I would like to create a visual in power Bi showing a bar chart of the top reasons why the Reef is deteriorating and go into further detail on the ones that have the most effect. For example, I know rising sea temperatures are a driving force in coral bleaching, so I would likely go into further detail on global warming over time with another visual, possibly a heat map here.

-I would also try to compare other oceans over time and see if the Pacific ocean has changed in temperature at a different rate to other bodies of water. 

-I would likely try to add another visual here comparing the different wildlife that has been most affected by this changing ecosystem, and what are the causes to that shift. 

-I would then like to focus on regeneration efforts, I know scientists are figuring out how to repopulate the coral, or figure out how to bring them back to their before state. The coral is not completely dead, it’s basically starving.

-I would use another visual here to represent the regeneration efforts from when it first began to modern day if possible, to show how much of the Reef has been regenerated, and basically include all uplifting information and research I’ve found to corroborate these changes.
