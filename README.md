Coral Bleaching: A Brief History and Overview of Catalysts and Effects

This project's aim is to analyze some of the causes of coral bleaching in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, highlighting the abundance of coral species in relevance to other species, as well as exploring the catalysts in our changing environment which aid the process of coral bleaching.

###I wanted to combine my interests for geography, maps, and nature into a project that could yeild interesting insights to a problem that I was aware of, but wanted to educate myself further on. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is a thriving ecosystem and one of the 7 Underwater Wonders of the World.


- 
Global Warming/Changing Water Temperatures
Enzo storm data research, both tables - brief overview of Enzo storm history
severe bleaching events??
It is known that the main reason for coral bleaching is due to rising water temperatures
acidity levels across oceans
sea rise and any other general global warming sea level temp trends
compare other oceans over time and see if the Pacific ocean has changed in temperature at a different rate to other bodies of water.
zoning coordinates CSV?? see if this is useful at all somehow with geojson
Wildlife/Ecosystems/Extenction Threat
Who has been most affected by coral bleaching, pull in tables to analyze, compare and contrast
list of threatened CSV
list of described species CSV
list of fish threatened CSV
list of perc coral coverage in specific area, as well as perc fish in specific area
^^USE WORD DOC eATLAS DATA SET REPORT TO EXPLAIN FINDINGS^^
Tourism
How does tourism affect the Great Barrier Reef?
Pull in tourism data CSV.. focus on certain years?
Pollution
global plastics pollution CSV
national carbon emissions CSV
global carbon budget CSV
find more data on plastic manufacturing? or specific pollution per country?
which oceans are most polluted
*add reference page *try to add downloaded json to some capacity
